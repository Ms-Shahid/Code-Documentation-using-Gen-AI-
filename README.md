# Code-Documentation-using-Gen-AI
Submitting a code file as input and obtaining a distinct output file with comprehensive code documentation facilitates a clear understanding of the code while preserving the original code structure.

**Technology used** -  GenAI

**Tools** - Azure OpenAI, Python
## Approach
1. Generating clear documentation with a separate file containing documented code.

2. Crafting effective prompts to obtain accurate code documentation.

3. Leveraging Azure Open-AI and Python to accomplish this task.

## Benefits 
**Improved Code Understanding** -
Clear & concise documentation & making it easier to maintain & modify code.

**Time & resource saving**-
Automated code documentation reduces the time & efforts required for manual documentation tasks.

**Language Adaptability**-
By fine tunning the prompts, documentation can be generated in various programming languages.

## Representation of Idea
**Step 1** : Select the code file. Programming language is classified based on the extension of the file.

**Step 2** : Fine tuning the prompts to get documentation according to the requirements.

**Step 3** : GPT-35 turbo model from OpenAI is trained with appropriate prompts.

**Step 4** : Code present in input file is processed.

**Step 5** : generates documented file as output in various formats.
